# Power Grid Management System
Class project (COSC 1437) aimed at simulating a Power Grid Management System. It allows users to manage and monitor various components of a power grid network including power plants, transmission lines, and substations.
## Features
- Adding and removing power plants of different types (coal, nuclear, solar).
- Managing transmission lines including capacity, length, and status.
- Monitoring substations responsible for power distribution.
- Implementing a fault detection algorithm to detect and handle faults in the power grid network.
- Optimizing the grid for load balancing and voltage regulation.
## How to use
1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open the project in a C++ development environment such as Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project.
## Implementation Details
- The project is organized into classes representing different components of the power grid.
- The main class `PowerGridManagementSystem` provides functions to interact with power plants, transmission lines, and substations.
- Additional functionalities such as fault detection, load balancing, and voltage regulation are implemented within the `PowerGridManagementSystem` class.
- The `main()` function demonstrates how to use the functionalities provided by the `PowerGridManagementSystem`.
