# Power Grid Management System
Class project (COSC 1437) aimed at simulating a Power Grid Management System. It allows users to manage and monitor various components of a power grid network including power plants, transmission lines, and substations.
## Features
- Adding and removing power plants of different types (coal, nuclear, solar).
- Managing transmission lines including capacity, length, and status.
- Monitoring substations responsible for power distribution.
- Implementing a fault detection algorithm to detect and handle faults in the power grid network.
- Optimizing the grid for load balancing and voltage regulation.
